# ðŸš˜ Car Car-ing Car-ed ðŸš˜
Blockchain-based solution that allows accurate car history records to be stored immutably in a trusted system and be made accessible to everyone. This aims to solve the information asymmetry that exists in the used car market by providing a single source of truth, which is contributed collectively by all actors in the car ecosystem, including car manufacturers, dealers and servicing workshops. With the transparency of car records, we have also incorporated an open marketplace which helps to facilitate the buying and selling of cars.
